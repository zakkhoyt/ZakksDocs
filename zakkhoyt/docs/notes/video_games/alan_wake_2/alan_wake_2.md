## First
1600

* b1

b2 - 128 = b3
2 * b1 = b3


1600 - 128 = 1472


368 per "unit" (U)
* B1 = 2 * U
  * 736
* B2 = U + 128
  * 496
* B3 = U
  * 368

736 + 496 + 368

On our Hero, the faraway Father still kept an eye,
And told her not to stand out in the light too bright
While the loving Mother and her Hatchling only tried to survive
When a tricky Witch opened a way into the dark lake,
Our Hero, against all caution, did a bold step take,
Away from the Sun which would make, her Blind to all that she could see

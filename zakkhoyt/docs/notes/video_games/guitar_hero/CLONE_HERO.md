## Audio Prep

* Add 2 seconds of silence
* Export as `.ogg` at 8 quality
* "Vocal Reduction and Isolation" -> drop center (hear guitars)

I downloaded a chords .midi file from [chordify.net](https://www.chordify.net) (subscription required) and converted it by using [midi-ch](https://efhiii.github.io/midi-ch/auto/)

Afterwards I put the created files into a folder with song.ogg file and it showed up on Clone Hero mobile (I gain access to my PC tomorrow).

When I play the song there it shows some buttons that I can strum, but those are only the chords.

So the notes won't appear this way.

Somebody told me here in the comments that you could use a .midi file from a song and insert it into mooncharters midi-auto-chart tool. Would this get me the result that I would expect / hope for?

There are no specific guitar / bass / drum / keyboard midi files available so I only get the chords as midi.

That's not enough I think?

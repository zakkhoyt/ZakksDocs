# Async Await

* `async let` lets you declare now, await later. It's a compiler promise. 



## Actors
* can read actor properties, but not write (from non-isolated context)
* Run code on the main actor with `MainActor.run {}`. 
* Annotate function that should only run on MainActor with `@MainActor`.
<!-- * `Sendable`, `@Sendable`, `nonisolated`.  -->
* `Sendable` is a protocol that indicates that a given value is safe to use in concurrent code
* You use the `@Sendable` attribute to require thread-safe values in your code
* Use `nonisolated` to opt an actor method out of confienment. 
* `let item = XCTUnwrap(items["\(i)"])`
* `GlobalActor` is a single, shared actor thatâ€™s accessible from anywhere.
  * `@globalActor actor MyActor {}`
  * Confine another class to MyActor with annotation: `@MyActor class MyClass {...}`

# HatchHomework 
Things I learned while reviewing candidate's homework:

# Measurement / Units

## MKDistanceFormatter
```swift
private func distanceFormatter(
  distance: Double
) -> String {
    let measurement = Measurement(value: distance, unit: UnitLength.meters)
    let formatter = MeasurementFormatter()    
    formatter.unitStyle = .long
    formatter.numberFormatter.maximumFractionDigits = 2
    return formatter.string(from: measurement.converted(to: .miles))
}
```
```swift
let formattedDistance = MeasurementFormatter().string(from: Measurement(value: distance, unit: UnitLength.meters))
            
```

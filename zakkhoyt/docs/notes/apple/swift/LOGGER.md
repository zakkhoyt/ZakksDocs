# Unified Logging
[WWDC](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10168/)

```swift
let logger = Logger(
  subsystem: Bundle.main.bundleIdentifier!,
  category: "ContentView"
)

logger.debug("testing debug: \(Int.random(in: 0...100))")
logger.info("testing info: \(Int.random(in: 0...100))")
logger.notice("testing notice: \(Int.random(in: 0...100))")
logger.error("testing error: \(Int.random(in: 0...100))")
logger.fault("testing fault: \(Int.random(in: 0...100))")
```

* Messages are renderd only when log is displayed
* Swift object that conform to CustomStringConvertible
* Non-numeric type (String or Object) will be redacted form the logs by default (so they dont' show personal info)
```swift
logger.log("Ordered smoothie \ (smoothieName, privacy: â€¢public)")
```
* types: `Debug, Info, Notice, Error, Fault` (aliases like `warning`, `trace`), (and `stdio, LLDB`)
* You can collect logs from an iOS device: 
```sh
# Connect iPhone to mac, then:
log collect --device --start 2020-06-22 9:41:00' --output fruta.logarchive
# open logarchive with Console.app
```
* log persistance depends on log level. From ephemeral to permanent: Debug, Info, Notice, Error, Fault
  * No level is persisted forever. 
* log performance is inverse of persistance. 
* Log formatting is supported (columns, alignment, and such)
  * hex, oct, binary, decimal, etc...
  * Useful for copying columns of data. 
  * hashing of private values (to make them public)

## Refactor expense
* Would need to consider each privacy object
* Cannot wrap the logger functions. The `OSLogMessage` string interpolation cannot be used in other functions (compiler error). Instead we would need to use composition. 

## Pros
* (as far as Xcode goes) `Logger` is a drop in replacement for `print()` and `Logger.xxx()` (our current logger)
* Possible to steam logs from iPhone to mac while running app when connected (QA folks can diagnose more easily)
* In Xcode console, the logs are color coded by level
* xcode 15 supports much richer filtering (same as Console.app)
* Jump to source (in xcode console)
* Makes logs more accessible

## Cons
* Does not print to console immediately (like print() does)
  * Mixing logger with print results in messages out of order. 
* No backing file
  * Do we really need a backing file?
    * Bugsee
    * Dev Menu -> Logs -> Share
* Makes logs more accessible
* We will lose file:function:line when viewing outside of xcode. 
  * Since we cannot wrap the logger functions, we would need to pass `#file`, `#function`, `#line` to every single log. 

## Questions
* How to view `.info` and `.debug` logs in Console.app? They seem to be filtered out. I can see the other levels. 
  * A: Turns out these are not persisted, even when I had `Console.app` recording while running the app on my mac. 
* Can we wrap the logger functions using that string interpolation?
  * A: no!
* Can we log long json bodies like we do with our current logger?
  * A: nope. There seems to be a limit. I did some testing and it only stored about 1024 characters of a json payload which was 50 lines. Not sure which is the limiting factor here. 


## Decision making questions
* Do we care about lack of long payloads? This might bite us when debugging. However we do have qa-tools, bugsee, embrace, etc...
  * Do we get value out of those long json payloads?
* Do we care about no backing file? 
* Responsiveness in Xcode (slower than print() and XCGLogger()). Mixing these tools results in unorderd logs.

```swift
extension os.Logger {
    func testAllLevels() {
        logger.notice("logger.notice")
        logger.info("logger.info")
        logger.debug("logger.debug")
        logger.error("logger.error")
        logger.fault("logger.fault")
        logger.warning("logger.warning")
        logger.critical("logger.critical")
        logger.info("logger.info")
    }
}
```
